## Questions:

### Achievements
- [ ] Give me an example of a project or initiative that you started on your own. What prompted you to get started?
  - **Cause:**
  During the Next Generation Tech Booster - Frontend Track - scholarship powered by Bertelsmann and Udacity, I needed a system to check my knowledge effectively and, at the same time, prepare for the assessment  (its results determined who would be admitted to the second phase of the scholarship).
  - **Action:**
  I started to collect the important topics, including questions that appeared most often on the Slack channels relevant to this scholarship. I created a repository on GitHub. I put questions there with answers and sources I refer to. I've developed a repetition system that works great for me.
  - **Result:**
  I have shared this repository with all fellowship participants. I received much support, thanks and additional questions, which I also included in the database. As a result of my work, I improved my markdown writing, passed the assessment and found myself in the second phase of the scholarship.
  

- [ ] Describe a project that you worked on, that led to your professional development.
  - **Cause:**
  A friend from college organized a charity rollerblade ride from Warsaw to Berlin. Its goal was to raise funds to treat siblings of children with SMA (a genetic condition that makes the muscles weaker and causes problems with breathing). She turned to me for help. She remembered that I was good at the HTML assignment and enjoyed it.
  - **Action:**
  I decided to help her. She had a very simple website with a chaotic structure of information needed to meet this event's goals. I created the information architecture for the website, missing subpages, support for automatic backups - independent of hosting, created e-mail accounts, added Google Analytics tools and the https protocol to the website, wrote posts on current events, information on the course of fundraising (I took care of SEO, i.e. to contain keywords for this site or internal linking etc.). I spent time learning WordPress, security issues and updating the site all the time.
  - **Result:**
  I acquired knowledge and skills in a new field for me. A friend started a charity initiative (now roll4you.org), and I administered the website. The ride was successful, and the amount has been collected. I really liked all these tasks, and this experience contributed to changing my career path to front-end development.

- [ ] Tell me about a time when you set a goal and met your objectives.
  - **Cause:** As a scholarship participant, I received a month's access to a learning platform, where, among other things, there was a Tailwind CSS3 course, which I had only heard about.
  - **Action:** I wanted to see how fast I could learn. My goal was to create a responsive layout based on Tailwind CSS3. I finished the course.
  - **Result:** I learned how to configure Tailwind, Vite, JSON files and learned the Tailwind file structure. I realized that it's quick to implement this CSS framework. I've created a responsive layout; you can view it in one of my repos on GitHub.


- [ ] Tell me about a time you exceeded expectations.
  - **Cause:**
  - **Action:**
  - **Result:**

### Adaptability
- [ ] Tell me about a time when you were asked to do something you had never done before. How did you react? What did you learn?
  - **Cause:** It was the beginning of our work. One of my clients asked me to redirect all her pages to one completely different web address. She was using a content management system which I was beginning to learn.
  - **Action:** I told my client that I'm learning about her CMS. I will check about this possibility in the CMS documentation and come back with an answer. I also passed on that based on my experience with another CMS- WordPress, with I'm familiar with - this procedure can be set, and change will be visible faster than in 24 hours.Â 
  - **Result:** I checked and came back with an answer. The pages were redirected, and the client asked me for additional work on the site and recommended me further.
